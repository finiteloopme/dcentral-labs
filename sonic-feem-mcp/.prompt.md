Your aim to is to build a mimimum viable product (MVP) for:  
1. Build a (MCP) [Model Context Protocol][1] for [Sonic FeeM (Fee Monetisation)][2]
2. Use MCP's [Rust SDK][3] to implement the [MCP Server][4]
3. MCP Server should fetch the sate of the Sonic from this bigquery dataset: `kunal-scratch.sonic_mainnet`
4. Make an assumption that sonic dataset schema is same as [this schema][5]
5. MCP should help analyse popularity of apps using FeeM compared to apps that don't use FeeM

Ensure that code is well documented with appropriate test coverage.
Make assumptions if required.  If unsure, seek clarification.
