/**
 * Constructs and submits a transaction that adds a new verifier key to the
 * blockchain for the given circuit ID at the given contract address.
 *
 * @param providers The providers to use to manage the transaction lifecycle.
 * @param contractAddress The address of the contract containing the circuit for which
 *                        the verifier key should be inserted.
 * @param circuitId The circuit for which the verifier key should be inserted.
 * @param newVk The new verifier key for the circuit.
 *
 * @returns A promise that resolves with the finalized transaction data, or rejects if
 *          an error occurs along the way.
 *
 * TODO: We'll likely want to modify ZKConfigProvider provider so that the verifier keys are
 *       automatically rotated in this function. This likely involves storing key versions
 *       along with keys in ZKConfigProvider. By default, artifacts for the latest version
 *       would be fetched to build transactions.
