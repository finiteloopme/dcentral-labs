 * Constructs and submits a transaction that replaces the maintenance

 *
 * @param providers The providers to use to manage the transaction lifecycle.
 * @param contractAddress The address of the contract for which the maintenance
 *                        authority should be updated.
 *
 * TODO: There are at least three options we should support in the future:
 *       1. Replace authority and maintain key (current).
 *       2. Replace authority and do not maintain key.
 *       3. Add additional authorities and maintain original key.
