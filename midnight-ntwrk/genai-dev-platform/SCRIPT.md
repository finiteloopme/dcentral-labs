We have convinced an enterprise to try out Midnight Network for a use case that requires programmable confidentiality.

Our exec sponsor is excited, the tiger team is ready to go.

Now the clocking is ticking.  This tiger team needs to learn about Midnight Network and how to leverage it effectively to deliver rational privacy, which involves the dual token, using DUST to pay gas fees, partial or incomplete transactions, etc. 
In addition they also have to wire up the require tools like: proof server, wallet integration, compact compiler.
Needless to say it is a steep learning curve for the devs.

And our goal is to stop this setup slog and make this team productive in days not weeks.

Welcome to Midnight Dev Platform, designed for instant, developer productivity.

[4]
Vision for this product is that a user should be able to describe the hybrid app they want to build and the product helps the user deliver a MVP in a short amount of time.

[5 - demo]
- Now let me give you a view of what this platform could look like. Some pieces in this demo are simple wireframes to give you an idea of how the platform can evolve with further investment. Though the code generation part using AI is captured live.
- Access to the users is immediate.  We have 8 users pre-provisioned
- They all have access to a pre-configured development environment or IDE
- It has all the midnight specific tools wired up.  Local proof server, wallet integration, local node setup, compact compiler, etc
- `midnight-dev --help`
- This `midnight-dev` is a helper utility, which is a wrapper for invoking midnight tools
- Now lets look at our GenAI tooling.  We have integrated opencode with Vertex AI, which gives us access to top Generative AI models via model garden
- Use Vertex is important because enterprise tend to have very strict policies around what data can be used with the Gen AI models.  And Vertex as a platform provides enterprises with that control
- Now let us try to build a sudoku game; I am going to give it an example of compact code.  We absolutely should pre-configure compact knowledge into this platform but I wanted to show how GenAI can help with new programming paradigms that they have barely seen before.
- Build me a sudoku game in compact lanuage.  Here is some code example: https://github.com/midnightntwrk/example-bboard and here are some docs: https://docs.midnight.network/develop/reference/compact/writing
- And voila you have compact here

So this platform delivers pre-configured development environments secured by the Google Cloud perimeter, eliminating onboarding friction and guaranteeing secure
